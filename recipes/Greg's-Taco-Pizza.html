    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>A great 12-inch taco pizza for any occasion. You may also want to try some sour cream for dipping slices.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>½ pound ground beef</li>
            <li>1 (1.25 ounce) package taco seasoning, divided</li>
            <li>1 (10 ounce) package prepared pizza dough</li>
            <li>1 cup fat-free refried beans</li>
            <li>¼ cup salsa</li>
            <li>4 ounces tomato paste</li>
            <li>¼ cup water</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon chili powder</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>1 small onion, chopped</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded Mexican cheese blend</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Place the ground beef in a skillet over medium heat, and sprinkle on half the package of taco seasoning. Cook and stir the beef until browned and crumbly, about 8 minutes; discard excess grease.</li>
            <li>Spread the pizza dough out onto a 12-inch round pan, forming a rim of slightly thickened dough around the edge. Mix together the refried beans with salsa in a bowl; spread evenly over the crust. Mix tomato paste, water, chili powder, cayenne pepper, and the remaining half of the taco seasoning mix together in a bowl, and spread the sauce over the refried beans mixture. Top with the cooked beef, sprinkle the onions over the pizza, and evenly spread the cheese on top.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the crust is cooked through and the cheese is bubbling and beginning to brown, 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
